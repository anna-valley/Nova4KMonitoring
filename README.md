Nova4KMonitoring

Web page programmed to monitor up to 12 4K Novastar processors.

The 4K Novastar processors have a built in web page GUI for monitoring over the network, but requires a page to be open for each one.

This enables you to monitor 12 at any one time in one webpage when remote to the racks.

I wouldnt try to control them though, this will probably break things, just monitor them!

There is a setup.js file which enables you to label all of the processors, just open it and change the names.

The IP addresses for the Novastars are pre-set, but could be changed if really required.

They follow the following pattern:

192.168.0.10
192.168.0.11
....
192.168.0.21

Let me know if you break it!
